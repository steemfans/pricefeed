## Install nodejs & npm
If you already have nodejs & npm installed you can skip this section, but I wanted to include it here for thoroughness. Run the following commands to install nodejs and npm in order to run the pricefeed software:

```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_9.x | sudo -E bash -
$ sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

## Setup & Installation
Clone the project repo into the "pricefeed" directory and install using NPM:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/DoctorLai/pricefeed.git pricefeed
$ cd pricefeed
$ npm install
```

Update the config.json file with your witness account name and private active key as described in the Configuration section below. Alternative, you can set account and private key in environment variables. 

### Run in background with PM2
I suggest using the PM2 software to manage and run your nodejs programs in the background. Use the following commands to install PM2 and run the pricefeed program:

```
$ sudo npm install pm2 -g
$ pm2 start feed.js
$ pm2 logs feed
$ pm2 save
```

If everything worked you should not see any errors in the logs and a price feed transaction should have been published to your account.

### Run in Docker
If you prefer using Docker, use the following commands:

```
# build your own docker image
docker build -t pricefeed .

# edit config.json and run container
docker run -itd \
    --name pricefeed \
    -v $(pwd)/config.json:/app/config.json \
    pricefeed

# Check the status with docker logs
docker logs pricefeed
```
